# Udemy-Java-Masterclass-Lambda-Expression-Challenge
In this challenge, Tim assigned a series of task for us to solve in order to demonstrate what we've learned so far about Lambda Expressions and how to use them 

        //Use the two methods you've made, perform the following tasks on the elements in the array with appropriate lambda expression
          //1: Transform names to all uppercase
          //2: Add a randomly generated middle initial and include a period
          //3: Add a last name that is the reverse of the first name
          //4: print your array or the array elements after each change using the forEach method at lease once
          //5: Create a new modifiable ArrayList from your names array removing any names where the last name = the first
